# TriantaduoOlimexRT1010
Port of the Arduino based TriantaduoWS2811 project on a Teensy 4.0 board to the RT1010 processor on an Olimex board

## Getting started
Created a new MCUXpresso workspace on my google drive and did the following:
* Selected the "Download and Install SDK's" from the "Welcome" page.
* Selected the "evkmimxrt1010" board, and then "Install".
* This resulted in the installation of "SDK_2.x_EVK-MIMXRT1010"
* Next, selected "Import SDK Examples" from the "Welcome" page.
* Selected "Go straight to the Wizard".
* Selected the "evkmimxrt1010" board by clicking on it's image, the "Next"
* Expanded the "driver_examples" section and selected the "flexio" subsection, and the  "flexio_pwm" project, then selected "Finish".
